# Windows

Using windows or Windows Server is the official way to set up a knockout city server for your needs. Here's how to setup and run the server.

## Requirements

- Windows
- [Winrar](https://win-rar.com) or [7Zip](https://7-zip.org) (optional)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) LTS (optional)

## Downloading the server

Downloading the server is pretty straightforward. The files for the server are included in all zip files distributed by Velan. But if you just want to run the server, you only have to download the server zip file. 

Head over to the [official page](https://www.knockoutcity.com/private-server-edition#section-download) and select the server zip file. 

Wait for the download to complete and then extract the server zip file either using the built-in unzip tool or whatever you prefer.
